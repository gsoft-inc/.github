At Workleap, we value [engineering principles at Workleap](https://medium.com/gsoft-tech/engineering-principles-at-gsoft-8f480f7c40cf) and you can see what they are by yourself.

Or, you can take a look at the whole [technical blog](https://medium.com/workleap) 🤓

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?

🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
